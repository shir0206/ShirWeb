###  üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Personal note:


  - This project is one of the projects I had the most fun doing.
  - I tried to *get out of the box* and design a website that visually looked clean and simple. Creating simplicity is, as it turns out, pretty complex.

  - In the **Intro** tab, a flower and caption animation is displayed.
     - I painted the flower manually as a digital painting using `100` different *shades*.
     - Next, I *exported* this painting as `SVG`, and used the `Anime.js` library to simulate the drawing process. (You can see this project [right here](https://github.com/shir0206/FlowerAnimation)).
     - Then I got excited about the result, and added an animation of a caption I wrote in *my own handwriting*.
  - The **Projects** tab shows my portfolio, using a *carousel* I built from scratch.
  - In the **Profile** tab you can read about me and [get in touch](mailto:shir0206@gmail.com)!
  - The **transitions** between the tabs produce an animation of brushstrokes.
  - In other words, the purpose of this project was to explore `animations`.
